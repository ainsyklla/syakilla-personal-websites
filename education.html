I commenced my educational journey at the age of 4 in a Kemas Kindergarten located in my village, specifically at Tabika Kemas Sri Seroja. I was enrolled in this kindergarten from the age of 4 until 6. Throughout this formative period, I acquired knowledge and engaged in recreational activities with peers of similar age.

My educational journey at SK Bertam spanned from Year 1 to Year 6. During my time at the school, I had the opportunity to expand my social network and interact with individuals from diverse age groups. In Year 5, I undertook the UPKK (Ujian Penilaian Kelas Kafa) examination, and subsequently, in Year 6, I sat for the UPSR, which is considered the most significant primary school examination. This chapter of my education is replete with cherished memories, particularly my attainment of a co-curricular award and my participation in a state-level co-curricular camp alongside three peers. Furthermore, I actively engaged in various sports activities at both school and zone levels.

Throughout my five-year tenure in secondary school, I actively engaged in a wide array of school activities and events, significantly contributing to my personal development and leadership acumen. Commencing as a hostel committee member in Form 1, I progressively shouldered greater responsibilities, including supporting teachers during school events and participating in community initiatives such as the dengue prevention program. In my final year, Form 5, I had the honor of being appointed as a school prefect and assistant hostel prefect. Notably, my Form 5 year was concurrent with the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting unique obstacles and valuable insights. Furthermore, during my secondary school tenure, I confronted two pivotal examinations: the PT3 in Form 3 and the SPM in Form 5.
Reflecting on my secondary school experiences, I hold the memories and lessons dear, as they have profoundly influenced my character.

After completing my secondary school journey, I began my pre-university life at SMKTIP. During this phase, I was accompanied by friends from my old school as well as new friends. Form 6 introduced me to many interesting things. The teachers in Form 6 were very kind and helpful in preparing me for university life. In Form 6, I took two major exams, STPM and MUET. I successfully navigated these exams with excellence and success.

Having completed prior educational stages, I progressed to the university level to pursue a degree. I was admitted to UiTM Kedah to undertake studies in the course of Bachelor of Science in Library Management Information. The duration of my program was 3 years, encompassing 6 semesters, and I chose to pursue full-time studies. This area of study is situated within the Faculty of Computing, Informatics, and Mathematics
